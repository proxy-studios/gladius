	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDefeatedTyranids" value="With the death of the last synapse creature, the Tyranids have turned from a horrifying army of synchronised killing, into feral animals.

	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDiscoveredOrks" value="Meeting Orks is almost a relief for a Guardsman -- after all, their behaviour is minutely detailed in The Imperial Infantryman's Uplifting Primer and most veterans will have encountered and fought them before. The men that survived generally report that Orks are unhealthily interested in where their next fight is coming from -- if you can avoid conflict with them, they will actually weaken over time."/>

	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDiscoveredTyranids" value="Through the experiments of Tech-Priests Genetors, the ravening swarm has come to Gladius Prime.

	<entry name="AstraMilitarumFlavor" value="<style name='Italic'/>&quot;Though our tanks and artillery are mighty, it is the vast ranks of Imperial Guardsmen that shall trample the enemy to dust -- let them come.&quot;<br/>  -- Ursarkar E. Creed, Lord Castellan of Cadia<style name='Default'/><br/><br/>The Astra Militarum, commonly known as the Imperial Guard, is the primary fighting force of the Imperium of Man. Across a galaxy of a hundred billion stars, there must be billions of Guardsmen at least -- yet even the Departmento Munitorum on Terra, which oversees this immense force, has no real idea of how many troops there are at any one time. A safe estimate is to say that there are millions of regiments.<br/><br/>What the Imperial Guard lack in strength, courage and resilience, they make up in numbers, organisation and fighting vehicles -- the Guard's wide range of tanks is rightly feared. The manpower of the Astra Militarum is predominantly human, though they do employ stable mutant strains, such as the giant Bullgryns. All these troops are equipped with the best mass-produced weaponry that the Techpriest war manufactories can provide, though it is often backward compared to that wielded by their enemies.<br/><br/>Across the vastness of galactic space, the vast majority of the Imperium's battles involve the Astra Militarum. It is by their actions and endless sacrifice that mankind has claimed and held its place in the universe."/>

He pauses for a moment and, in a shaky hand, annotates the entry.<br/><br/>&quot;Gladius Prime: main planet of the Gladius System, Segmentum Obscurus, Ixaniad Sector.

	<entry name="AstraMilitarumWonEliminationFlavor" value="The colony has been saved -- well, what remains of it. The few remaining Xenos are fleeing to the corners of the planet. Hunting them down should be well within your veterans' capabilities. Truly, you are a war leader to rival Macharius!<br/><br/>With the eventual clearing of the warpstorms, the planet will return to Imperial rule. Rogue Traders will arrive, its cities will be rebuilt, the skulking civilian population will be bolstered by colonists from nearby sectors. Within a generation, it will be a viable colony again, sending its Imperial tithe like any other. Within ten generations, it may be a rich world supplying its own regiment to the Imperium. Within a thousand, it may be a depleted hive world, rife with corruption and filth, a cramped, impoverished home for future humanity. All this, for the glory of mankind -- and for the Emperor!"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumWonQuestFlavor" value="You will never know why the Tech-priest betrayed you and the Imperium, what he was trying to achieve, and what function the artefact on his gun-ship truly served. But with his elimination and the dispersal of the warpstorms, communications have been restored.<br/><br/>Yet the planet's few surviving astropaths have astounding news, straight from Terra itself. Whilst the warp storms shielded your planet, the wider Empire has seen great upheaval. Cadia has fallen, the galaxy has been rent asunder by the warp, and Roboute Guilliman, foremost of the Emperor's Primarchs, has awoken from his ten thousand-year slumber.<br/><br/>Despite this, your army will not be joining Guilliman's crusades. Gladius Prime's unique artefacts and strategic location mean you have been permanently assigned here -- to protect the planet and the explorators, come what may."/>
	<entry name="CompendiumFlavor" value="In the Imperium's 41st millenium of existence, the challenges humanity faces are variously internal and external, but uniformly terrifying. The old enemy, Chaos, eternally threatens the weakened armies of the Astra Militarum, Adeptus Astartes, Adeptus Sororitas and Adeptus Mechanicus. Hordes of Orks, Tyranids, and other Xenos species predate on the isolated Imperial worlds. And Eldar, Necron and Tau carry out their inscrutable plans, seemingly careless of the loss of human life they inflict."/>

	<entry name="NecronsDefeatedNecrons" value="A rival dynasty on our Crownworld? Of course we repudiated, fought and destroyed them. But we pity them too, for the thousands of years they slept only to wake here and die at our hand. Perhaps it is easier to pity them, now that they are all dead."/>
	<entry name="NecronsDefeatedOrks" value="When dealing with a rabble, especially a primitive warrior rabble, the key thing is to outthink them and dissect their formations slowly. Would that there were any left for the Crypteks to experiment on."/>
	<entry name="NecronsDefeatedSpaceMarines" value="For a youthful race, these elite humans certainly have sophistication and power about them. Or rather, 'had'. Perhaps a more in-depth examination of their ruined Fortress Monastery or vivisection of our captives will give us better insights into their capabilities and weaknesses."/>
	<entry name="NecronsDefeatedTyranids" value="We have eliminated the hegemonising swarm organisms. Picking apart the remains of these beasts, they are obviously not from the local system or perhaps even this galaxy. They are monstrously strong though -- would that they were pliable enough to be trained and kept as slaves."/>
	<entry name="NecronsDiscoveredAstraMilitarum" value="A weak, fleshy race, humans are fast-breeding and intensely territorial. Their strength lies in their numbers, their war machines and their formations -- disrupt them and they will crumble like sculptures in the sand."/>
	<entry name="NecronsDiscoveredNecrons" value="A rival Necron dynasty has somehow established itself on the planet during your aeon-long slumber. They return your heralds in pieces and ignore your demands. They must be defeated to prove your ownership of this, your Crownworld."/>
	<entry name="NecronsDiscoveredOrks" value="The Crypteks tell you that these are members of a race created solely for war. Whilst their equipment is technologically crude, their numbers, sheer physical power and psychic drive means they shouldn't be underestimated as a foe."/>
	<entry name="NecronsDiscoveredSpaceMarines" value="Whilst notionally the same race as the weak Astra Militarum, these beings have heavily modified and trained themselves, to the extent that they should be treated as a separate -- and much more dangerous -- faction."/>
	<entry name="NecronsDiscoveredTyranids" value="What are these things? The Cryptek's records are silent on them -- they must have been discovered long after your hibernation began. They seem to move with an uncanny co-ordination for apparent beasts -- perhaps we can find out more through dissection?"/>
	<entry name="NecronsFlavor" value="<style name='Italic'/>&quot;Cast off the shackles of your slumber! The galaxy shall be ours once again!&quot;<br/>  -- Anrakyr the Traveller, Necron Overlord<style name='Default'/><br/><br/>An eternity ago, the Necrons forsook the frailties of flesh for deathless bodies wrought from cold metal, in their subjugation to the star-gods known as the C'tan. In their new immortal form, they took on the then-masters of the galaxy -- the Old Ones -- and in aeons-long battle they defeated them. In their desperation, the Old Ones seeded the galaxy with psychic races, thus awakening the horrors of the warp, and the Necrons -- weakened by a simultaneous battle of liberation from the C'tan -- retreated to their homeworlds.<br/><br/>There, falling into hibernation, they slumbered for untold time. As other races were born and drove themselves to extinction, they lay deep and undisturbed in multitudinous worlds, tended and defended in their not-sleep by their monstrous Canoptek automata.<br/><br/>Now, across the galaxy, they are awakening. Even here, this Crownworld's master circuits are stirring. The Necrons -- now unthinking machines, save for their few Lords and Triarchs -- are arming themselves for war again. Their technology is millennia ahead of that of the galaxy's younger races. Soon, legions of sinister, advanced war machines will pour from the tombs buried beneath the planet to conquer and enslave -- nothing mortal is safe."/>
	<entry name="NecronsLostFlavor" value="You waited millennia to test yourselves against the Old Ones' progeny... and failed. Your armies are destroyed, the raised extrusions of your cities obliterated. Now the survivors are retreating to their impregnable tombs, whilst the Canoptek automata seal the way behind them. Elsewhere, beneath the planet's surface, tens of thousands of your kind still sleep. Perhaps, in a few millennia more, you will wake together. Then -- finally then -- the galaxy will be yours."/>

	<entry name="NecronsWonEliminationFlavor" value="After untold millennia, you have finally reclaimed your world from the Old Ones' scions. Now, nothing walks on the surface of Gladius Prime that isn't a Necron or a slave. You can start the long task of uncovering the remaining tomb complexes and scouring the surface of the enemy's ramshackle structures.<br/><br/>Who knows what waits outside the warp storm? The Old Ones? The C'tan? With time, you're sure the psychic maelstrom will subside and you will find out. When it does, you will be prepared, your armies replenished and rebuilt. But you're in no rush. You've already waited aeons, after all. For your final vengeance, you can wait a little longer."/>
	<entry name="NecronsWonQuestFlavor" value="You will always remember with pleasure the howls of the Deceiver shard, as the Silent King's hidden weapon worked alongside the Old One technology to dissect him alive. Now the Deceiver lives on throughout your crownworld, as shards bound screaming into your Tesseract Labyrinths, powering the engines of your creation.<br/><br/>This new weapon made the reconquest of your world trivial. The rest of the Old Ones' spawned races surrendered or died with their cities when it was deployed against them. These slaves now mine the planet for its rich artefacts.<br/><br/>The warpstorm still looms overhead. You wonder what lies beyond it -- a C'tan-consumed void, a resurgent Old One empire, or something stranger. Perhaps, one day soon, you will stumble across the artefact that clears the turmoil from the sky, and you will emerge and challenge the galaxy's rulers once more -- if they still exist at all."/>

Heavily-muscled, aggressive, eight-foot-tall fungal thugs with a love of warfare, the Orks were a spacefaring peril long before the human Imperium entered the galactic scene. Spread evenly across the galaxy, for the most part they are an irritant to any other inhabitants, like lazy, belligerent neighbours. But occasionally, as a swarm of locusts, the scattered tribes and clans form into a Waaagh! -- something between a crusade and a riot -- and devastate entire sectors until they run out of things to fight and fall instead into internecine warfare.<br/><br/>That's not to say the Orks are completely primitive. Despite their thuggish demeanour, they possess a low intelligence augmented by genetically-coded technical excellence. Their technicians -- called Meks -- build raggedy, ugly vehicles, buildings, guns and spaceships, which should fall apart at first use, but actually perform their job surprisingly effectively. Imperial scholars believe this is due to the pervasive psychic power of the Orks, which simply fills in the technical gaps that should prevent all their devices from working.<br/><br/>In battle, Orks attacks are undisciplined rampages, full of boisterous chanting and joy of warfare. Their crude weapons and blunt tactics mingled with their resilience and sheer numbers make them a dangerous foe. Even when defeated, their bodies spread spores which, in time, will grow into more Orks, plus their servant races -- Grots, Squigs and Snots -- which keep them alive. Even when every last Ork is dead, the Orks are far from defeated."/>
	<entry name="OrksLostFlavor" value="As the last Ork keels reluctantly dead to the ground, the Waaagh! finally falls silent. Green bodies and blood litter the ground, everywhere, entangled with crude machinery and firearms. Snotlings and Squigs pick over the carcasses for food. The Ork threat to Gladius Prime has been dealt with.<br/><br/>But this isn't a loss for the Orks, exactly -- after all, they had a really good fight, which is all Orks ever wanted. And there's never an end to the Orks. Even though you and your Boyz are returning to the mud, your dying bodies will spread spores to every corner of this planet.

To find the source of the warpstorms, to root out the remaining Old One secrets. Pray that no-one else finds them before you..."/>
	<entry name="SpaceMarinesWonQuestFlavor" value="The Chapter Master fulfilled his duty to the Emperor, at an immeasurable cost to the Imperium -- Gladius Prime has been scoured clean by the Exodite device, down to its rocky surface. It will be a long and slow road towards re-establishing the Chapter after this disastrous 'victory'. The Chapter's few survivors will need to find a new planet to call home. Then the Fortress will need to be reconstructed from scratch, new recruits found, trained, tested and modified, and gene-seed implanted. For generations, the Chapter will rebuild, whilst others seize the glories that should have been yours.<br/><br/>Yet, one day, elsewhere in the Imperium, Roboute Guilliman will lead the Space Marines again, standing side by side with the Astra Militarum and the Techpriests, against the old enemies. And this Chapter, replenished, a thousand superhuman heroes strong, will fight alongside them. For the chapter's glory -- and for the Emperor!"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids" value="Tyranids"/>
	<entry name="TyranidsDefeatedAstraMilitarum" value="Of course, they all died. Of course. They relied on order, ranked troops, heavy armour, artillery, respected generals. Gaunts destroyed their order, genestealers danced through their ranks, bioacid dissolved their armour, gargoyles descended on the artillery, and the Lictors tore their generals apart."/>
	<entry name="TyranidsDefeatedNecrons" value="A waste. To kill such things, to see their constructs crushed, their fliers snatched from the sky, their floating rocks brought down by a sheet weight of bodies... is nothing. No reward, no satiation of hunger, only loss. The Hive Mind moves on, hungrier than before."/>
	<entry name="TyranidsDefeatedOrks" value="The Greenskins cannot recover from this one. The corpses of the grots, snots, Orks and squigs are dissolving in reclamation pools, ready to make more Tyranids. But even at the microbial level, the Orkoid spores are being consumed by the Tyranid's Phage Cells. The WAAAGH! stops here."/>
	<entry name="TyranidsDefeatedSpaceMarines" value="Another chapter falls, wiped by alien claws, more darkness on the face of the galaxy. Does the Emperor, bound light years away into his Golden Throne, feel this loss? Do his dead eyes cry? On Gladius, the blood of his children is now finding its way into the fresh-growing bodies of Hive Fleet Tiamat..."/>
	<entry name="TyranidsDefeatedTyranids" value="This is no defeat -- this is the resolution of a difference of opinion, another moment of evolution. The weaker, grosser hive mind lost out, and now all the information, all the genetic data it gathered, all the biomass, has been added to its stronger sibling's stores. For all their striving, this survivor is the best of both minds."/>
	<entry name="TyranidsDiscoveredAstraMilitarum" value="The Hive Mind flexes its psychic muscles hungrily. If this infinite alien mind were capable of favoritism, these human animals would be its preferred prey. In the birthing chambers lightly armoured Hormagaunts and Lictors are being born to chase down the human infantry, whilst Carnifexes and Exocrines are gestating, so that they might crack open the armoured vehicles, to access the tender interiors."/>
	<entry name="TyranidsDiscoveredNecrons" value="The Hive Mind grumbles with distress at the sight of the dark metal figures. Not only is this an obstacle that is free from the weapon of fear; not only is it relentlessly powerful, but in death it gives nothing back to the swarm. To fight such a thing is always a loss to the swarm, even when victorious. Better avoided."/>
	<entry name="TyranidsDiscoveredOrks" value="The Hive Mind can recognise in the Ork race a kindred creature, but unconscious. After all, are not the greenskins empowered and directed by a similar spirit? Are they not a fellow swarm, that covers the galaxy, driven by a race-wide desire? To battle something so similar must be a strange feeling for the solitary mind."/>
	<entry name="TyranidsDiscoveredSpaceMarines" value="The Hive Mind must feel hunger, but also caution. Though inside their metal shells these creatures are the same as the smaller humans, they have proved themselves far more capable and difficult to assimilate. On planet after planet, system after system, these have thwarted the Hive Mind, pushed it aside from biomass, or even destroyed tendrils entirely. Caution then."/>
	<entry name="TyranidsDiscoveredTyranids" value="Two Hive Minds? What horror is this? Race on race of identical monsters, evolving at the same pace, moving in the same way. Two clone armies battling each other, matched blow for blow, tearing each other apart only to rebuild the remains in the same. The planet's survivors look on, aghast, knowing that whoever wins, they lose."/>
	<entry name="TyranidsFlavor" value="<style name='Italic'/>&quot;They come from between the stars, a god of hunger made flesh, to harvest the galaxy of life.&quot;<br/>  -- Inquisitorial Xenologist, Darnye Gotopo<style name='Default'/><br/><br/>The Tyranids are the most alien of the races to infest Imperial space, for they come from beyond. Their hive fleets stretch out like tendrils, great chitinous bio-ships drifting in brooding silence. Once the remorseless shoals of the bioships detect the presence of a prey world, they close upon their target, grasping it like some many-tentacled beast seizing its food. In the ensuing invasion, the world will be consumed, for the Tyranids hunger for all living matter. There is no escape from this final embrace and when the Tyranids finally depart, they leave behind a barren world, a scoured ball of rock now devoid of anything that lives.<br/><br/>A Tyranid hive fleet consists of millions of living starcraft, each home to untold numbers of monstrosities evolved from the geno-organs of the ship's reproductive chambers. All the creatures serve the entity that is the ship, and the ship exists only as part of the horrific super-organism that is the fleet. Even when dead, organic matter is reconstituted back into the ship, along with captured biomass from the invaded planet. It is then all dissolved into a rich biological gruel used to make new Tyranid creatures, each ready to serve the Hive Mind and begin the feeding process anew.<br/><br/>But on Gladius, the Tyranids are few and scattered, brought here by meddling men. The warp storms keep them distant from the will of the Hive Mind and the Imperial citizens think of them merely as pests. They should worry more..."/>
	<entry name="TyranidsLostFlavor" value="The Hive Mind would not consider this a defeat. A small loss of biomass, yes, a tendril vanished of its myriad remaining in the darkness between the stars. But to experience defeat the Hive Mind would have to recognise a foe -- and in the solipsistic universe of a galaxy-spanning mind nothing has yet proven itself worthy, save for lost fragments of itself. Pity the Tyranid, who cannot know victory, who knows not what it has lost."/>

Driven by the gestalt consciousness of the Hive Mind, the Tyranids overwhelm their prey with weight of numbers. Those that are not swept aside under a tide of razor-sharp claws and lethal bio-weaponry fire are smashed asunder by gigantic alien monsters the size of battle tanks."/>
	<entry name="TyranidsWonEliminationFlavor" value="Every piece of biomass, every atom of air, the rocks of the planet's surface, all have been harvested. Still, the planet fights the swarm, burning it, crushing it, subjecting it to the horrors of the warp, and each time the swarm rebuilds, with less biomass than before. The swarm has won -- but it remains trapped beneath Gladius' ancient defences, a swarm of ants beneath glass, tormented by the mechanisms of long-dead gods."/>
	<entry name="TyranidsWonQuestFlavor" value="When the Explorator ships finally reached Gladius Prime, generations later, to see if anything was left to be reclaimed, the planet itself had gone. Instead, around the sun called Gladius was a metallic asteroid belt in the same orbit. And, of course, the Tyranids were long gone..."/>
