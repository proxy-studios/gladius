	<entry name="Tip12" value="Items"/>
	<entry name="Tip12Description" value="Hero items can be found from exploration, received from quest rewards or bought at the Jokaero Trader Encampments.

	<entry name="Tip15Description" value="To open the city screen, you can click on the city name or click on the headquarters twice.

	<entry name="Tip16" value="City Buildings"/>
	<entry name="Tip16Description" value="Here, buildings are listed with their available actions.

	<entry name="Tip17Description" value="The research screen presents your faction's unique technology tree. Begin by selecting a technology to research from Tier 1.

	<entry name="Tip20Description" value="Your city has acquired a special resource tile with no <icon height='20' texture='Icons/Attributes/BuildingSlots'/> building slots.

	<entry name="Tip21" value="Construct Resource Building"/>
	<entry name="Tip21Description" value="To keep your war machinery in operation you will have to construct specialized resource buildings. Build a resource building like you built the infantry building. The tile on which the building is placed may modify the building's resource output -- look for matching resource icons.

	<entry name="Tip22Description" value="There are free <icon height='20' texture='Icons/Attributes/BuildingSlots'/> building slots in the city: an opportune time to make plans to expand your army.

	<entry name="Tip23" value="Produce Infantry"/>
	<entry name="Tip23Description" value="You can now produce units. Queue up as many as you like, but watch your resources.

	<entry name="Tip24Description" value="Every building except the headquarters requires one <icon height='20' texture='Icons/Attributes/PopulationLimit'/> population to operate. You'll have to research and construct <icon height='20' texture='Icons/Buildings/AstraMilitarum/Housing'/> housing to increase your population <icon height='20' texture='Icons/Attributes/Growth'/> growth and limit. If you run into trouble due to a shortage of population or other resources, you can disable some buildings to let the rest operate at full efficiency by clicking the <icon height='20' texture='Icons/DisableBuilding'/> button next to each building group."/>
	<entry name="Tip25" value="Loyalty"/>
	<entry name="Tip25Description" value="If your city's <icon height='20' texture='Icons/Attributes/Loyalty'/> loyalty drops below 0, it will negatively impact building efficiency.

	<entry name="Tip27" value="City Edicts"/>
	<entry name="Tip27Description" value="Edicts are city-wide effects that can be issued by expending influence. Multiple can be active at a time, but each activation lasts only a limited amount of time. Timing these correctly can help you prevail on Gladius."/>

	<entry name="Tip28Description" value="Something has attracted objects with extraordinary powers to Gladius, and the surface is littered with Old One tech of all sizes and kinds.

Once all adjacent units holding control of an artefact have been killed, the artefact can be captured by right-clicking on it with a unit selected."/>
	<entry name="Tip29" value="Operations"/>
	<entry name="Tip29Description" value="Space Marines are able to issue strategic and tactical operations by expending influence. One such operation is the deployment of a Fortress of Redemption -- a stationary unit that secures adjacent special resource features.

	<entry name="Tip30" value="Stationary Unit"/>
	<entry name="Tip30Description" value="Some units cannot move but can still perform actions. If they have weapons, like the city headquarters, they can attack. To perform an attack move your mouse over enemies and right click."/>

	<entry name="Tip34" value="Rapid Fire"/>
	<entry name="Tip34Description" value="This unit has a rapid fire weapon equipped. Units with rapid fire weapons are able to cause much more damage at close range, but can still fire from further away. It might be worth moving closer before attacking."/>
	<entry name="Tip35" value="Powerful Creatures"/>
	<entry name="Tip35Description" value="There are some frighteningly powerful creatures on Gladius Prime. It would be wise to gather a sizable force before engaging these beasts."/>

	<entry name="Tip37" value="Out of Resources"/>
	<entry name="Tip37Description" value="You are low on resources! Move your mouse over the resources on the top left of the screen to find out why. Perhaps it would help to disable a building, construct a building or two, or establish a new city."/>
	<entry name="Tip38" value="Colonization -- Necrons"/>
	<entry name="Tip38Description" value="Canoptek Spyders allow you to erect a city that will form the backbone of your dynasty on Gladius.

	<entry name="Tip41Description" value="You are now be able to produce new units, maintain your economy and understand the basic concepts of the game.

	<entry name="Tip42" value="Claim Item"/>
	<entry name="Tip42Description" value="To claim an item and transfer it to your hero click on it in the unclaimed items panel in the top left.

	<entry name="Tip43" value="Terrain"/>
	<entry name="Tip43Description" value="Terrain affects units in a variety of ways.

Tiles marked with red indicate enemies that can be attacked from your current position."/> <!-- Click OK and hover over a tile marked with a red outline. -->
	<entry name="Tip44" value="Unit Abilities"/>
	<entry name="Tip44Description" value="Some units have extra abilities that can be utilized to gain an edge in combat.

	<entry name="Tip45" value="Overwatch"/>
