	<entry name="AutoFlavor" value="These robust weapons are automated, self-loading firearms that fire bursts of high-velocity, caseless shot. Auto-weapons come in a variety of forms, from the common autopistol to heavy support weapons like the punisher gatling cannon."/>
	<entry name="BarrageFlavor" value="Barrage weapons lob shells high into the air, landing them in the midst of the foe."/>
	<entry name="BlastFlavor" value="Blast weapons fire shells, missiles or packets of energy that explode on impact."/>
	<entry name="BoltFlavor" value="The boltgun, or bolter, fires small missiles known as 'bolts'. Each self-propelled bolt explodes with devastating effect once it has penetrated its target. There are many variations of boltguns, from the short-barreled bolt pistol to the Vulcan mega-bolter often mounted on Titans and other super-heavy vehicles."/>
	<entry name="FlamerFlavor" value="Flamers are short-ranged weapons that spew out highly volatile clouds of liquid chemicals that ignite on contact with air. They are primarily used to scour the enemy from defended positions, as walls are of no defence against blasts of superheated vapour."/>
	<entry name="ForceFlavor" value="Force weapons are potent psychic weapons used exclusively by trained psykers. By instilling a portion of his mental might into the weapon, a psyker can strike his foe with an incredible storm of power that ravages and overloads his enemy's nervous system, leaving him a mindless shell."/>
	<entry name="GaussFlavor" value="Gauss weapons vary in appearance from the rifle-sized flayers to the massive heavy gauss cannon. Unlike more conventional energy weapons, a gauss projector emits a molecular disassembling beam, reducing flesh, bone and even armour to its constituent atoms."/>
	<entry name="KlawFlavor" value="Orks favour brutal power klaws over the more sophisticated power fists of other races. These huge hydraulic shears are capable of rending and crushing even the toughest foes. Ork walkers are fitted with klaws that befit their greater size, and can rip through anything foolish enough to stand in the pilot's way."/>
	<entry name="LasFlavor" value="Las weapons fire packets of explosive laser energy -- the larger the gun, the more powerful the shot. Regardless of size, las weapons are incredibly reliable, making them favoured tools of war throughout the Imperium."/>
	<entry name="MeltaFlavor" value="Melta weapons are lethal anti-armour guns, most effective at very short range. When fired, the super-heating of the air produces a distinctive and sinister hiss. Solid rock is reduced to molten slag, and living creatures are vaporised in an instant!"/>
	<entry name="MeleeFlavor" value="Warriors across the galaxy employ a wide variety of close-quarter weapons. Blood-flecked chainswords and crude knives take their places alongside powered weapons of all kinds: swords, axes, hammers and many more. All such weapons are designed to bring quick and painful death to the foe, for every moment's delay brings defeat a step closer."/>
	<entry name="ParticleFlavor" value="These weapons emit a stream of minuscule antimatter particles that detonate upon contact with their target. They are incredibly reliable, needing only enough energy to maintain the containment field that prevents the anti-matter from detonating within the weapon's own firing mechanism."/>
	<entry name="PhosphorFlavor" value="Phosphor weapons range from the hand-held serpenta favoured by many Tech-Priests to the heavy phosphor blaster mounted upon Kataphron Battle Servitors. The burning white spheres that shoot out from phosphor weapons cling tenaciously to their targets, sizzling wildly as they melt into flesh or burrow through armour and exoskeleton alike. More often than not, it is these luminagenic orbs that deal the death blow. Even if a target proves tough enough to survive the burning pain, the phosphorescent glow these spheres exude can guide an ally's volley to strike the same target."/>
	<entry name="PlasmaFlavor" value="Plasma weapons fire pulses of searing energy that are extremely effective against heavy infantry and light vehicles. However, they generate enormous temperatures when fired and are thus prone to overheating -- sometimes proving deadly to the firer."/>
	<entry name="PowerFlavor" value="A power weapon is sheathed in the lethal haze of a disruptive energy field that eats through armour, flesh and bone with ease."/>
	<entry name="ShootaFlavor" value="Shootas are noisy, large-calibre machine guns. They vary wildly in size and design, from those carried by foot-slogging Boyz to long barrelled supa-shootas that are mounted on aircraft. Regardless of their particular design, all shootas are both deafening and deadly."/>
	<entry name="StubFlavor" value="These are low-tech solutions to ranged warfare on high-tech battlefields. Encompassing such weapons as shotguns, stub guns and heavy stubbers (sometimes called sluggers), the common bond between all of these weapons is that they are, without exception, cumbersome, noisy and fairly primitive firearms. Often employed by gangers, law enforcement officers and even civilians across the Imperium, these weapons make a formidable din when fired, and are easy to maintain."/>
	<entry name="TailBiomorphFlavor" value="The tails of some Tyranids are deadly weapons, from bony protrusions dense enough to cave in the side of a tank to stingers containing enough poison to kill whole regiments."/>
	<entry name="TeslaFlavor" value="A tesla weapon unleashes a bolt of living lightning that crackles from foe to foe after hitting its target, charring flesh and melting armour. Tesla bolts feed off the energy released by the destruction, the lightning becoming more furious with every fresh arc."/>
	<entry name="ThoraxBiomorphFlavor" value="Certain Tyranids have thoracic cavities that play host to swarms of parasites -- some of these minute creatures drain their victims' vital fluids, others emit an electrical charge which plays havoc with enemy vehicles, and others still nestle amongst the foe's armour before exploding in a horrific fashion."/>
