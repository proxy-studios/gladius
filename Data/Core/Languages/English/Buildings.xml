	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/AircraftFlavor" value="This landing field was designed for larger craft -- almost up to the intra-system scale -- but with the endless warpstorms, it's been repurposed to house the Imperial air forces. Much like a Skyshield landing pad, it has limited field generators to protect grounded aircraft from incoming fire."/>

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/ConstructionDescription" value="Building that constructs new buildings and generates influence."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/ConstructionFlavor" value="Whilst the Administratum runs the entire Empire of man, the Departmento Munitorum is tasked solely with supplying the manpower and supplies for the Astra Militarum. Among their many tasks is the construction of large facilities, such as airfields or orbital stations. The poor grunts who have to do the work are the Labour Corps, indentured or penal workers and mind-wiped servitors."/>

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/EnergyDescription" value="Building that generates energy."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/EnergyFlavor" value="Whilst the ancients may have split the atom, the Empire's Techpriests have had millennia to perfect the rituals by which they draw up power. The open-core Plasma Ioniser uses coolant-infusion systems to maintain an output of around 100 petawatts for up to a hundred days at a time -- around 10,000 times that of the largest historical fission plant."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Food" value="Soylens Farm"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/FoodDescription" value="Building that harvests food."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/FoodFlavor" value="Soylens viridians might be filling, nutritious and easy to grow in great vats -- but as a foodstuff it has some drawbacks. First, it's utterly bland and flavourless. Second, it looks like green gloop. Third, it's made from any available organic matter. Persistent rumour has it that human corpses are not excluded."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Loyalty" value="Sanctum Imperialis"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/LoyaltyDescription" value="Building that increases loyalty."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/LoyaltyFlavor" value="The local seat of the Imperial Cult may appear dark and gothic, but is in fact a hallowed place. Adorned by statues of saints, it is a venerated local symbol of the Emperor's godlike will, and provides inspiration to the nearby populace."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Headquarters" value="Basilica Administratum"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/HeadquartersDescription" value="Headquarters building that generates resources."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/HeadquartersFlavor" value="The central administrative building of any Imperial colony, the magnificent Basilica is a temple to bureaucracy. Generations of plain-clad clerks live and die amidst tottering tomes, deciding the fate of star systems with the feeble thump of their stamps. As the saying goes, the Inquisition may burn you, the Astartes smite you -- but only the Adeptus Administratum can torment you for your entire life."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Heroes" value="Shrine of the Aquila"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/HeroesDescription" value="Building that produces heroes as well as generates influence and increases loyalty."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/HeroesFlavor" value="Far more than a mere statue, this great metal eagle was cast from the molten remains of space-faring vessels, and serves as an inspiration for those nearby. The Imperial troops that fight under the Aquila's ceaseless vigil find a new determination welling in their hearts, knowing that they are the last in a line of heroes that stretches across the stars."/>

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/HousingDescription" value="Building that increases population limit."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/HousingFlavor" value="The classic Imperial structure, these identikit city buildings are seen all over the Empire. They provide the minimum amount of shelter and comfort required for the people of the Imperium to eke out their short lives. At a colony's founding, sometimes they're built in situ -- but more often, on remote planets, they're dropped directly from any colonising spaceships."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Infantry" value="Imperial Barracks"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/InfantryDescription" value="Building that produces infantry as well as increases population limit and loyalty."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/InfantryFlavor" value="Whilst the training of recruits to the Imperial Guard has none of the harrowing horrors suffered by Astartes initiates, the Munitorum still has to drill the strictures of the Empire into the tithed men and women that make up most Guard regiments. Here, at the Barracks, a planet's unpromising conscripts are turned into the true Astra Militarum -- by giving them uniforms, guns and perhaps even some training."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Influence" value="Cogitator Station"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/InfluenceDescription" value="Building that generates influence."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/InfluenceFlavor" value="Though artificial intelligence is an abomination, long abhorred since the fall of the Men of Iron, the archaic data looms of the Adeptus Administratum bear little resemblance to ancient computers or even to the slim microprocessors used by the Techpriests of Mars. Cogitators functions are purely bureaucratic, their form immobile. Still, their capabilities are prized by every Imperial world purely for their inhuman memory."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Ore" value="Ore Extractor"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/OreDescription" value="Building that harvests ore."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/OreFlavor" value="Depending on the planet, extraction of metal ores and valuable minerals is undertaken by anything ranging from ancient-tech machinery barely controlled by its Techpriest magos to thousands of Labour Corp workers, playing their part in the war to save mankind."/>

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/PsykersDescription" value="Building that produces psykers as well as generates energy and influence."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/PsykersFlavor" value="Whilst the warpstorm rages, the peacetime use of psykers -- as astropaths, for long-range communication -- is pointless. Similarly, without being able to reach the Black Ships, unwanted psykers can't be transported to Terra for sacrifice at the Golden Throne. Instead, most are executed, with a select few drafted into Imperial service as Sanctioned Psykers."/>

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/ResearchDescription" value="Building that generates research."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/ResearchFlavor" value="Learning to be an officer of the Astra Militarum is a thankless, often lethal task. One of the safest postings is to the Officio Tactica, where the smartest tactical minds analyse ongoing military manouevres and refer to the copious texts of the Tactica Imperialis for well-tested advice. They also record their current campaigns, so that future generations might learn from them."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Upgrades" value="Cult Mechanicus"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/UpgradesDescription" value="Building that produces Techpriest Enginseers and generates research."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/UpgradesFlavor" value="The Techpriests worship of 'the Omnissiah', a machine-god, would surely be frowned upon, were it not for their usefulness. Instead, a tacit agreement is in place; the Techpriests acknowledge publicly that the Emperor was the Omnissiah and the Administratum agrees not to pry too closely."/>

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/VehiclesDescription" value="Building that produces ground vehicles as well as generates ore and research."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/VehiclesFlavor" value="To call an Imperial Manufactorum a 'factory' is akin to calling a Catachan Devil an insect. These cyclopean structures are huge, forbidding temples to the Machine God, wherein his miracles -- here vehicles of war -- are created. Inside them, lowly menials are doomed to never see the planet's surface, as they ceaselessly minister to the blessed engines of Mars."/>
	<entry name="CompendiumFlavor" value="From the shanty town huts of the Orks, to the billion-person hives of the Imperium, to the space-faring Craftworlds of the Eldar, to the ancient mastaba of the Necrons, almost every race produces structures to satisfy their needs -- whether that's construction, shelter, or merely pride. Perhaps only the Tyranids, in their insatiable search for new biological materials, lack permanent structures, instead relying on a range of semi-mobile birthing organisms..."/>

	<entry name="Necrons/AircraftDescription" value="Building that produces aircraft as well as generates energy, research, influence and increases loyalty."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/AircraftFlavor" value="If the Necron are dreaded across the known universe, their aircraft are doubly feared. The Doom Scythe and Night Scythe are fast, hardy and deadly to armoured opponents. Launching from a bleak expanse of stone, they devastate enemies with their irresistible assaults."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Construction" value="Slave Mastaba"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/ConstructionDescription" value="Building that constructs new buildings as well as generates influence and increases loyalty."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/ConstructionFlavor" value="Everyone has a place in Necron society. The weak-fleshed races of the Old Ones live out their days under crude shelters, where they scrape together their own food, before being sent out to excavate the Necron's long-buried tombs and retrieve the sleeping Necrons."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Energy" value="Energy Core"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/EnergyDescription" value="Building that generates energy."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/EnergyFlavor" value="Whatever the baroque technology is that the Necron use in their great Energy Cores, it outshines even the Imperial Plasma Ioniser for sheer power -- and it needs to, given that the Necron dynasty depends upon its power supplies as other races do on water or food."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Loyalty" value="Baroque Shrine"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/LoyaltyDescription" value="Building that increases loyalty."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/LoyaltyFlavor" value="While the Stelae talk of the ancient Necrontyr's victories and glories, this Shrine tells a darker story. It details their conversion to metal and subjugation by the C'tan, and of Szarekh the Silent King and his long-planned betrayal and destruction of the soul-eating Star Gods. Even amongst the soulless Necrons, this inspires reverence."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Headquarters" value="Royal Court"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/HeadquartersDescription" value="Headquarters building that generates resources."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/HeadquartersFlavor" value="The seat of the Necron Phaeron and his court is a great bleak building, one of the few great Necron buildings not originally built to venerate the dead. Instead, its shielding walls are a symbolic reflection of the intense radiation the Necrons suffered under, long ago, on their original homeworld, when they were still weak creatures of flesh and bone."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Heroes" value="Royal Pyramid"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/HeroesDescription" value="Building that produces heroes as well as generates influence and increases loyalty."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/HeroesFlavor" value="The tomb of the Phaeron, Overlord or Lord and his court, this is where all the most loyal and important retainers retreated to sleep away the centuries until the universe was ready again. Even now, great heroes still lie sleeping in its core, awaiting their Lords' call."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Housing" value="Shelters"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/HousingDescription" value="Building that increases population limit."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/HousingFlavor" value="Given the average Necron's lack of need for water, food or entertainment, these shelters don't resemble a human shelter or even an Ork shack. Instead, they're partway between a barracks, a tomb and a workshop, where the Crypteks and Canoptek constructs move between dormant Necron warriors, endless maintaining and repairing them."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Infantry" value="Summoning Core"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/InfantryDescription" value="Building that produces infantry and creatures as well as generates research and influence."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/InfantryFlavor" value="Awakening the long-deactivated troops of a Necron dynasty is slow work, as is repairing those who fall in the field. The Canopteks and Crypteks of the Summoning Core diligently save those who recall to the city -- and dismantle the rest for their rare Necrodermis."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Influence" value="Stelae"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/InfluenceDescription" value="Building that generates influence."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/InfluenceFlavor" value="Imposing, sky-piercing columns of ancient stone and metal, each Stela records the reign of a long-ago Phaeron of the Necron dynasty. To see the records of millennia of implacable domination makes even the most stolid citizen of the Empire quail."/>

	<entry name="Necrons/OreDescription" value="Building that harvests ore."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/OreFlavor" value="To find the rare materials the Crypteks need to maintain and repair the living metal necrodermis and weaponry of the Necron troops, slaves live and die in their Al-Khemic quarries and smelters. Only a tiny fraction of the output is used -- but it's critical to the Necrons' survival."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Research" value="Forbidden Archive"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/ResearchDescription" value="Building that generates research."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/ResearchFlavor" value="Before the fall, Necron Crypteks were already masters of eldritch technology, able to manipulate matter and energy in ways that seemed magical to lesser races. With immortality came generations of learning, and the Cryptek conclaves become more powerful than ever -- yet the millenia have made them stagnant. In these archives, the Conclave digs for the wisdom of the ancients, rather discovering the secrets of the universe anew."/>

	<entry name="Necrons/VehiclesDescription" value="Building that produces ground vehicles as well as increases loyalty."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/VehiclesFlavor" value="This high-roofed building is lined with pillars inside. Between them rest or float the great war machines of the Necrons. Deactivated Doomsday Arks, Annihilation Barges, Monoliths and Obelisks wait in serried ranks for the day when a Lord calls for their repair and they can lead his armies once more."/>

	<entry name="Orks/BeastsDescription" value="Building that produces beasts, generates food and influence as well as increases loyalty."/>
	<entry name="Orks/BeastsFlavor" value="Runtherds do much of the heavy lifting in Ork society, overseeing the Grots who build everything, the Squigs who supply almost all resources and the tiny Snots who are both carers and food for the Squigs. However, on these grounds they also oversee larger projects -- like training Grotz gun crews and rearing the giant Squiggoths."/>

	<entry name="Orks/ColonizersDescription" value="Building that produces Meks and Mek Gunz as well as generates research."/>
	<entry name="Orks/ColonizersFlavor" value="A Mek never knows when inspiration is going to hit and he suddenly needs a Thingummy or a Whatyamacallit for his latest invention. For this reason, a Mek's yard is full of broken-up vehicles, machines and tools in case he needs anything suddenly to hand, with teams of lugubrious Grotz endlessly hauling more stuff in."/>

	<entry name="Orks/ConstructionDescription" value="Building that constructs new buildings, generates ore and influence as well as increases population limit."/>
	<entry name="Orks/ConstructionFlavor" value="Ork buildings are inelegant constructions of waste materials and any scrap that the Meks don't need. The Grotz aren't known to be good architects, but the Orks don't care so long as they get a good fight."/>
	<entry name="Orks/Energy" value="Powwa Gubbinz"/>
	<entry name="Orks/EnergyDescription" value="Building that generates energy."/>
	<entry name="Orks/EnergyFlavor" value="It doesn't pay an Ork to look too closely at the generators that power their world. That's because much of the technology that Ork Meks produce is missing key parts and shouldn't actually work -- but the massed psychic belief of Orks somehow overrides this."/>

	<entry name="Orks/FoodDescription" value="Building that harvests food."/>
	<entry name="Orks/FoodFlavor" value="Squigz are essential to the survival of the Ork species. A huge variety of these small creatures accompany every Ork, and fill an array of social and technological niches -- from acting as wigs, to providing oil, to being eaten as food."/>

	<entry name="Orks/LoyaltyDescription" value="Building that increases loyalty."/>
	<entry name="Orks/LoyaltyFlavor" value="Orks don't establish dominance by persuasion, but by brute force. A Nob or Warboss is simply a bigger Ork -- and the longer they fight, the bigger they get. Fights for dominance or disputes are often worked out in the ritual pits, entertaining the whole Warband in the process. (It's an unfortunate Ork that confuses these pits with the identical looking 'drops' -- the Ork toilets.)"/>

	<entry name="Orks/HeadquartersDescription" value="Headquarters building that generates resources."/>
	<entry name="Orks/HeadquartersFlavor" value="Once a Warboss has amassed an army of a certain size, he can no longer command with the simple cudgelling and swearing his boyz have grown to love. The Boss Tower doubles up as a place for the boss to live and a bully pulpit from which he can bellow at his hordes."/>

	<entry name="Orks/HeroesDescription" value="Building that produces heroes as well as generates influence and increases loyalty."/>
	<entry name="Orks/HeroesFlavor" value="The Blood Axe Clan of Orks are somewhat shunned by their brethren, for not being 'real Orks'. This is because they've adapted to the proximity of humans over the long-millenia and adopted some very un-Orky behaviour, like Taktiks and Runnin Away. Blood Axe Kommandos have gone one step further, using camouflage to surprise their enemies."/>

	<entry name="Orks/HousingDescription" value="Building that increases population limit."/>
	<entry name="Orks/HousingFlavor" value="Curiously, the Grotz' Hutz are better than those of the Boyz. Sure, from the outside they look even more ramshackle and run-down, while the inside is  still built from garbage festooned with mushrooms, squigs and snotlings. But there's a certain pride and personalisation in the squalor that the Boyz' shacks lack."/>

	<entry name="Orks/InfantryFlavor" value="'What's better than a gun?' asks an Ork. 'A bigga gun', answers another. Shortly before the fight starts, they agree that, even better than the biggest gun, is a big pile of big guns.

	<entry name="Orks/InfluenceDescription" value="Building that generates influence."/>
	<entry name="Orks/InfluenceFlavor" value="The Ork psykers known as Weirdboyz are a peril at the quietest of times, given their endless accumulation of Waaagh! energy -- and in the middle of a horde, a brain bursting chain reaction is normal.

	<entry name="Orks/ResearchDescription" value="Building that generates research."/>
	<entry name="Orks/ResearchFlavor" value="One of the more persistent myths of the Orks is about their long-vanished creators, the 'Brainboyz', who they believe encoded highly advanced technology into the Orks' genes aeons ago.

	<entry name="Tyranids/HeroesFlavor" value="Whilst the Anthropia emerge solely from the Aedanthropum's long-gestation sacs, the most complex synapse creatures take even more of the Hive Mind's resources and, crucially, focus. Each Tyrant, Tervigon and Prime requires careful design from the Mind, to give it that balance between total control and useful independence. The concentrated sensoria of the Ovipository enable that focus."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Housing" value="Hibernation Marsupia"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/HousingDescription" value="Building that increases population limit."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/HousingFlavor" value="Excess biomass and genetic data are simply stored in the thickened walls of the biostructures or flow twitching between them. But when a creature has been grown, sometimes the Hive Mind deems it more efficient to retain it but shut down its functions, stored in serried ranks of marsupia."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Infantry" value="Brood Nest"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/InfantryDescription" value="Building that produces infantry and beasts as well as generates biomass."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/InfantryFlavor" value="While a Norn Queen normally produces all the creatures of a Tyranid invasion, in the circumstances that a brood is physically isolated from the Hive Fleet, certain specialised structures are used. Smaller creatures like Termagants are gestated in the pods of this nest, fed and warmed by the unthinking structures."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Influence" value="Synapse Node"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/InfluenceDescription" value="Building that generates influence."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/InfluenceFlavor" value="The Hive Mind's capabilities aren't spread evenly throughout its structures -- somewhere, there needs to be concentrated systems for thought. In the Hive Fleet, these are the Norn Queens. On the ground, these synapses act as temporary back-ups to the network effect from its individual creatures, allowing the Mind to focus on more objectives than simply controlling the swarm."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Loyalty" value="Coherence Node"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/LoyaltyDescription" value="Building that increases loyalty."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/LoyaltyFlavor" value="An Imperial scholar, might make an analogy between a coherence node and something like a radio tower -- and, certainly, it's orchid-ear appearance fits -- but it doesn't transmit but receives. The node's folded surfaces track the locations of the Hive Mind's creatures for the most efficient deployment of its synapses, to prevent the Hive swarms falling into anarchy and chaos."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Research" value="Genetic Epicure"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/ResearchDescription" value="Building that generates research."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/ResearchFlavor" value="Though the Malanthropes are responsible for physically collecting genetic data from a planet's population, the Epicure is the structure that processes those samples. Inside the Epicure's fluted mass, delicate structures pare and sort the genetic samples, testing them on a microscopic scale for useful innovations. When something is discovered, it is immediately communicated to the Norn Cyst and hence onto the Hive Mind."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Thropes" value="Aedanthropum"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/ThropesDescription" value="Building that produces Thropes and generates research."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/ThropesFlavor" value="Not all Tyranid creatures are equal; whilst Termagants and Hormagaunts require little focus and unspecialised resources, the construction and gestation of more complex creatures can take more care. In isolated hives like that of Gladius, the diverse support creatures the Imperium calls Anthropia -- Venomthropes, Zoanthropes and Malanthropes -- all emerge from a specialised biostructure of gristly columns, podia and caverns."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Vehicles" value="Brood Haunt"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/VehiclesDescription" value="Building that produces ground-based monstrous creatures and generates biomass."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/VehiclesFlavor" value="Some of the Hive Mind's creations are produced by separate biostructures because of the care and resources taken in their rendering. Others are simply large. The Brood Haunt houses those brutish giants that are far too big for the Brood Nest. Inside this high-spined haunt, womb-caverns of bone filled with suspensory fluid allow the layering of muscle and bone for these monstrous giants."/>
