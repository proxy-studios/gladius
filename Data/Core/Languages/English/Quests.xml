	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story0" value="Chapter 1: Life in the Guard"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story0BeginningDescription" value="Gladius Prime had seemed an excellent placement for a senior Imperial administrator. With its rich resources and strategic location, it was both easy and prestigious to rule. For the local people, life had been by the book -- until the day the planet's space stations fell flaming from the sky and the Orks descended, followed by even worse Xenos horrors. The resident Space Marine chapter stood fast but could barely hold out.<br/><br/>As the Commander of the reinforcing Astra Militarum forces, you landed on the planet months ago -- but the unexpected reappearance of the planet's warp storms has trapped you on the surface. You've regrouped the surviving civilians and Astra Militarum troops into one city, but there are still soldiers scattered beyond the walls. We must gather them, rebuild our cities, and reclaim this planet. For the Emperor!"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story0Stage0Description" value="Our first stage is to get the Imperium's war factories back online. In an Imperial Manufactorum, colonists can live and die without ever seeing the outside world, endlessly building war machines for the glory of mankind."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story0Stage1Description" value="We must find our scattered allies and foes. The Imperial Sentinel scout walker may be fragile, but its speed will allow us to explore the planet more quickly. Build one as soon as possible."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story0Stage2Description" value="From the safety of his sentinel, the pilot reports that surviving civilians are being hunted by the degenerate Kroot -- a polymorphic Xenos species gone feral."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story0EndingDescription" value="We've established the city and secured our borders. Yet our troops are severely understrength -- but that's a problem for a later time."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story1" value="Chapter 2: Rallying the Remnants"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story1BeginningDescription" value="Though we've rebuilt our city and cleared its perimeter, our missing soldiers outside the city are still being hunted down by the foul Xenos. Through night and day, the guardsmen's desperate pleas for help dominate our Comm-links. We must gather them, rebuild our cities, and reclaim this planet. For the Emperor!"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story1Stage0Description" value="The guardsmen are moving in small groups, surviving by using established covert warfare techniques. Contact them and recover them."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story1EndingDescription" value="With this many soldiers reclaimed, we can rest more easily behind our walls. But we must still keep reinforcing -- the Xenos cannot be allowed to take this world."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story2" value="Chapter 3: A Palace Fit For A Priest"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story2BeginningDescription" value="Among the surviving guardsmen of the expedition, we've made a lucky find -- an Imperial Tech-priest of Mars. He has an idea as to what might be causing the warp storms, but our current facilities aren't sufficient for his research, nor is the location of our city propitious for the rites of the Machine God. He insists we expand our civilisation beyond these walls, then build Cogitator Stations in two cities to aid his research. With distance, he theorises that he can measure disturbances in the warp between the twin cities, and use the computing machines to locate the storm's source. With his help we can surely clear the swirling clouds of the warp and call the Imperium for aid. This plan is our best -- our only -- hope."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story2Stage0Description" value="Make preparations for expansion and build a Cogitator Station -- the souls of the humans on this planet depend on you."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story2EndingDescription" value="The Cogitator Station stands tall above the plain, proclaiming the Emperor's might to any who might oppose it. Deep inside, the Tech-priest is building his laboratory."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story3" value="Chapter 4: Through the Storm"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story3BeginningDescription" value="Ensconced in the subterranean workshops of the Cogitator Station, the Tech-priest has rapidly built a small army of Servitors and Skitarii, apparently to study the planet. The Astra Militarum guarding the city have been reporting strange experiments and are uneasy in his presence -- but then the cult of the Machine God has always been somewhat otherworldly. Upon emerging from his workshops, he reports that the key to the warp storms seems to be the unusual artefacts that are sometimes uncovered on the surface of the planet. He insists we bring any we find to him -- but many are in the hands of the Xenos. We will have to search, beg, barter or steal it from them."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story3Stage0Description" value="Each artefact is unique and highly sought-after. One of them may be the key to calming the Warp Storms -- if it is, we must find it."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story3EndingDescription" value="We have found three unusual devices that fit the Tech-priest's description. Now he must research them."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story4" value="Chapter 5: Hold the Line"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story4BeginningDescription" value="Meeting the Tech-priest has become... difficult. The soldiers around his chamber seem less to be guarding him than guarding the city against him. You meet in something like No Man's Land inside the Cogitator Station, to transfer the artefact, surrounded by armed troops and his newly-repaired Kastelan robots. The Tech-priest's cybernetic eyes glitter red as you silently hand over the strange equipment. As he turns to go, you catch his sleeve and the soldiers all freeze. &quot;How soon can we expect results?&quot; you ask. His vocoder hisses static and spits &quot;soon&quot;, before he stalks away. You leave, troubled. Soon enough you experience the results."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story4Stage0Description" value="Alarms ring throughout the city. Of all things to face, Enslavers! Warpborn horrors man has only heard of in folk tales are assaulting the city. And the Tech-priest has vanished. Survive the attack -- we will deal with him soon enough."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story4EndingDescription" value="The Enslavers are vanquished, beaten back to the warp, at great cost. In the Tech-priest's abandoned chambers you find horrors beyond human ken -- and an artefact that must have lured them. What was he doing? We must find him."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story5" value="Chapter 6: The Better Part of Valour"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story5BeginningDescription" value="The Tech-priest has betrayed you -- why, you don't know. Perhaps he was always loyal to Mars, perhaps the whispers of heresy penetrated his mind. Whatever the reason, he has made his escape while you were busy building palaces and battling foes. Your scouts have located his hiding place -- he has installed an artefact on an offworld gunship, apparently hoping to punch through the warp storm with it. You must stop him before he does. Beware though -- his Kastelan war machines are amongst the best ancient Martian technology can produce. This will be a hard fight."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story5Stage0Description" value="The Tech-priest and his machines stand ready for battle."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Story5EndingDescription" value="As you defeat the last of the Tech-priest's troops, a failsafe trigger is activated. The still part-repaired gunship detonates, activating the artefact. Across the planet, the psychically-sensitive sigh as the warp storm fades away. Your Astropaths make contact with the Astronomican again and send out a call for aid. Emperor willing, soon enough, the Imperial Navy will arrive and this planet will be reclaimed for the Imperium!"/>
	
	<!-- Necrons -->
	<entry name="Necrons/Story0" value="Chapter 1: Scourge of the Old Ones"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Story0BeginningDescription" value="As the proud leader of a Necrontyr dynasty, you'd never known defeat. Never, until your people met the Old Ones, and dared to attack their star-spanning empire. Your dynasty had been on the frontline when the war with the Old Ones started, and you were some of the first to face their wrath. Your Fringeworlds were scoured and your Coreworlds besieged for generations. When the C'tan called the Messenger -- and now the Deceiver -- promised your people immortality through biotransference into undying machine bodies, you snatched at it greedily. Later, you betrayed him and his kind, shattering them into C'tan shards now used as weapons.<br/><br/>To no avail, sadly. Though your new soulless bodies were nigh-indestructible, even as their empire collapsed the Old Ones encircled your crownworld and used their uncanny powers to trap you within it, driving their warp technology into its surface, binding you to the depths. You retreated to the underground stasis tombs that Szarekh, the Silent King, had ordered constructed, and waited for the final assault -- which never came. Eventually, you slept, awaiting the Silent King's call.<br/><br/>Now, sixty million years have passed and you've awoken into... chaos. Signs of battle between the Old Ones' humanoid creations litter the surface, as do the ancient enemy's traps. These devastated your people upon awakening, leaving a few surviving tombs widely scattered. Through the warp storm, you can hear nothing from your overlord Szarekh.<br/><br/>Where are the Old Ones? Who won the war? Is this another trap? Where are your C'tan gods? We must investigate -- cautiously."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Story0Stage0Description" value="Our first task is to quickly wake a cohort, to defend against the Old One's forces."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Story0Stage1Description" value="The living have spread across this world like weeds -- particularly the virulent humans, the Old One's final curse, whose primitive dwellings cover the surface. Enslave them if you can, exterminate them if you cannot."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Story0Stage2Description" value="A human leader cursed us as he lay dying, and revealed in his ignorance the location of one of our retreats. We must see if our brethren still live."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Story0EndingDescription" value="Only a Necron could tell that this tomb was breached from the outside and resealed. Who or what waits for us inside?"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Story1" value="Chapter 2: Messenger From the Past"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Story1BeginningDescription" value="One of the tombs holds a Triarch Praetorian called Eystan -- a Necron judge. However, he is not of our dynasty, but instead a traveller who became trapped here, long after our slumber began. He tells us that after we destroyed our C'tan gods at the orders of the Silent King, we were victorious in the War in Heaven, crushing the Old Ones. Afterwards we slept, weakened by battle. <br/><br/>In those dying days, Eystan's group had been dispatched into the webway to lead an invasion of  Old One homeworlds -- but  he lost his way in the maze and became stranded on our world when the Webway collapsed. He forced his way into the tomb's entrance, but with no way to enter it proper, has spent sixty million years alone, listening to the waking galaxy. This obfuscating warp storm is a new phenomenon -- he believes intended to trap us here."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Story1Stage0Description" value="Eystan thinks he knows a way off the planet, involving the fragmented Webway portals -- but it involves awakening a Cryptek of our dynasty. Fortunately, our records indicate that a chronomancer Cryptek loyal to the dynasty was entombed nearby."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Story1Stage1Description" value="It will take some time for the Cryptek's delicate mental machinery to recover fully from the long sleep -- but we can accelerate the process by exposure to the world outside, and to battle."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Story1EndingDescription" value="The Cryptek, Ptanotek, is fully recovered and as keen as anyone else to discover Eystan's putative Webway escape route. But her instruments show something unusual in a distant tomb -- Necrons who respond to no signals, who are massacring everything they come across, be they beast, man, or Necron..."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Story2" value="Chapter 3: Fragments of the Destroyer"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Story2BeginningDescription" value="When we slew our star-gods, the C'tan, they didn't die easily. After all, they were fundamental parts of the universe who had achieved sentience. They couldn't be truly annihilated, only atomised and trapped, lest they re-coalesce. And those who had time left a curse in their death, like Llandu'gors' Flayer disease that drives so many of our warriors to madness.<br/><br/>The Destroyer Cults -- which have sprung up on the peripheries of our cities too -- are another reflection of the C'tan's curse. These nihilists are drawn from the best of us -- Immortals, Lychguard and Lords -- and in their madness, seek only the death of all life.<br/><br/>But whilst we can communicate with our local cults, this maddened army is incommunicate and kills isolated Necrons alongside the living. We must stop them, if we can."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Story2Stage0Description" value="The rebel Necrons have formed into an army, led by a formidable Lord. Let us tackle them carefully, when we are ready."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Story2EndingDescription" value="What a loss -- your people, turned to such mindless horrors. Eystan reports that many such dooms have befallen the Necron people since awakening, for daring to raise their hands against their gods."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Story3" value="Chapter 4: Vaul's Anvil"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Story3BeginningDescription" value="Ptanotek, the Cryptek, has studied the warp storm and come to a conclusion -- the Old One technology that maintains the storm is embedded in this planet. The machine that built it is surely here too. If we can find it, she's sure that she can reverse-engineer its technology, and perhaps dissipate the Warp Storm.<br/><br/>That might be harder than it sounds. For, in the intervening millennia, Eldar, Man, Ork, Jokaero and stranger creatures have left their creations on your Crownworld's surface, and cannibalised the Old One's technology. Gather their artefacts for the Cryptek to study, and we may be able to find the mechanism by which to control the Old One machinery."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Story3Stage0Description" value="These artefacts range from palm-sized devices to floating monoliths taller than a Tomb Stalker, but the Cryptek insists they are all useful."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Story3EndingDescription" value="If the Cryptek Ptanotek could still drool, she would. Examining the artefacts, she takes an ancient piece from each and rapidly rebuilds a giant Old One artefact, which she asserts could control the storms. Silencing the Cryptek's protests, Eystan volunteers to test it, far from the city -- and you agree."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Story4" value="Chapter 5: A Messenger Revealed"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Story4BeginningDescription" value="Eystan has been gone only a short time, the mountainous artefact floating behind, when the Cryptek demands an audience. Her Scarabs enter en masse with her, prompting your Lychguard to gather about you defensively. Instead of conflict, though, the Scarabs bring something else.<br/><br/>Ptanotek explains her scarabs were exploring a long-destroyed Old One habitat, when they happened on some unusual remains. Before she could personally investigate, her scarabs were driven off by the Psychneuein which had infested the ruin.<br/><br/>But they did manage to recover one thing -- she presents you with a Rod of Covenant, a traditional Praetorian weapon. One that absolutely should not have been in an Old One ruin. What is going on?"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Story4Stage0Description" value="The Cryptek demands that she investigate the Old One building personally -- and you agree."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Story4Stage1Description" value="Under the building is an Old One vault, with human and Necron tracks leading to its sealed door. The Cryptek can unseal it -- but it will take time."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Story4EndingDescription" value="You personally attend the vault's opening. Inside the ruin, you discover long-dead remains -- human warriors and a group of Triarch Praetorians, including a mangled corpse that is visibly Eystan's. Yet you saw him right before the Cryptek discovered this vault -- or something that looked like him, at least."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Story5" value="Chapter 6: The Silent King's Secret"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Story5BeginningDescription" value="Eystan communicates with you -- or, rather, the thing that pretended to be Eystan does. It is a transcendent shard of Mephet'ran, the Messenger, the Deceiver, the same C'tan who doomed your people to these metal bodies with its mellifluous lies. Around it stands a legion of your fellow Necrons, blank-eyed like the Destroyers you defeated before.<br/><br/>In Eystan's tortured voice, Mephet'ran gloats that you have handed it the keys to the Old One's technology, and invites you to submit to your ancient masters. You cut off the communication in despair.<br/><br/>Your Cryptek has her own secrets, however. From a hidden stasis tomb, a Spyder raises a cherished gift from the Silent King, saved from the days of rebellion -- an Aeonic device explicitly made to kill a C'tan. If we can recover the control device and use the Old One and Silent King's technology side by side, we can crush this hubristic C'tan.<br/><br/>And once we've shown the other races of this planet that we can crush even a Star God, surely they will fall in line too."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Story5Stage0Description" value="Shortly, Doom Scythe scouts report that the arrogant C'tan has left the control device with an army of his soulless Necrons. A lightning raid with your full force should be sufficient to drive them off and reclaim it."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Story5Stage1Description" value="Rather than dissipate the warp storm, the Cryptek plans to ramp it up, so much so that the atmosphere crackles. This will burn away at everything physical -- with the solely-physical C'tan affected most of all."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Story5Stage2Description" value="The C'tan too late realises its error and, burning with the Old Ones energies, orders its soulless armies to attack. If you can defeat it, you will cow the slave races by making them witness a god's destruction."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Story5EndingDescription" value="The Cryptek deploys her Aeonic weapon, and the thing that killed Eystan one moment screams incoherently and the next whimpers incoherently, its incomprehensible intelligence splintered a hundred-fold into Tesseract Vaults under your command.<br/><br/>Knowing now that Eystan was The Messenger, you know that everything he told you was almost certainly a lie -- to think that the Necrons could have defeated the Old Ones without the C'tan is beyond comprehension.<br/><br/>Beyond the warp storm, the Old Ones doubtless still rule -- but here, you shall stay safe inside this defensive tempest they have so kindly created. This shall remain a true planet of the Necrons, with you ruling over these mortal slaves until such day as you are strong enough to challenge the galaxy once again."/>

	<entry name="Orks/Story0BeginningDescription" value="&quot;Zogging Gork, that 'urt!&quot; You dig yourself out of the wreckage of your Boss Tower and see a few boyz around you doing the same -- but very few, injured and demoralised. An old Dok, Bonez, stomps his way through the rubble towards you. &quot;Most of the boyz is dead, boss. That zogging storm got 'em. Plenty of spare bitz though.&quot; He hefts a detached Ork arm in his hand thoughtfully. &quot;Anyhow, as the only Dok still standin', I reckon yer boyz could do with some R&R. I prescribe 'physikal exercize'. Should fix 'em up nicely!&quot; He grins a mouthful of steel teeth at you. &quot;RIGHT&quot; you bellow at your boyz. &quot;Who wants a fight?&quot; Ragged cheers greet you from across the camp."/>

They drop it on the floor and back away rapidly. &quot;Wossat? A big Faceeater? A mushling?&quot; you ask, kicking the sack. &quot;Naw, it's just Wurrrdred.&quot; Bonez answers, as an Ork lurches howling out of the sack's mouth, his eyes fizzing. A dangerous tension builds in your head as the greenskin psyker gets near. You shove him back, knocking him on his backside. &quot;The other Weirdboyz' 'eds all popped inna storm.&quot; says Dok, &quot;and 'e says he can feel the fing wot did it.&quot; Wurrrdred nods, and drools. &quot;It's a Gork fing,&quot; he gibbers &quot;I swears it.

	<entry name="Orks/Story1EndingDescription" value="Nearby can be heard the sounds of Ork celebration -- cheering, gunfire and the occasional scream of a grot. Wurrrdred, however, is wandering, his Warp-addled mind restless amidst the Imperial ruins. He squats down by a seemingly-inconsequential rock, sniffs at it, then presses his hand into a crack. A great chasm opens up before him, plunging into the depths of the planet. &quot;Erk,&quot; he mumbles to himself, dropping pebbles into it, &quot;Wot's dis fing?&quot;"/>

The aeons-old space hulk that brought you to this planet was grounded by the warp storm and terribly damaged. Your few remaining Meks are putting their heads together to fix it, hoping that you can get off-planet and continue your Waaagh! away from this murderous storm. Because, as Bonez said, &quot;Even Orks can't fight da sky!&quot; As you watch, the Mek's banging triggers something it shouldn't. The giant engine suddenly hiccups, flash-frying him and a nearby herd of Squigs.<br/><br/>You're gnawing on your fourth flambeed Squig when Wurrrdred and his entourage bring the good news. They've found the Gork and Mork gubbins -- sort of."/>

You order the detention of all Astra Militarum forces, but this soon gets out of hand, with your Marines executing Guardsmen on sight.

It acts as something like a prison, keeping the Necrons trapped beneath an eternal warpstorm, and triggers terrible surface devastation to deal with more significant threats. More importantly, the Necron we fought weren't the sentient enemies we've fought before -- but mindless beasts, scoured of intellect. We must discover more."/>

It appears to be an ancient artefact, like many others that dot the planet, constructed of a material similar to the Cadian pylons.

Its destructive power is akin to the Exterminatus action -- but this is usually carried out by a fleet of ships, not a gunmetal case a Marine can carry in one hand. More terrifying is its presence on this world -- who knows what else might be located in the depths, amongst the Old One ruins, and their abominable creations?<br/><br/>Weak as the Chapter is, you cannot hope to hold this planet, or to prevent the device or the structures from falling into the hands of the old enemy, Chaos. The device and the planet must be destroyed, even at the cost of the Chapter itself. Then the Master of the Forge presents a sliver of hope -- that even in death, the Chapter's geneseed could be preserved, buried deep beneath the monastery, and hence survive this... Exterminatus device. You order work to begin immediately."/>

	<entry name="SpaceMarines/Story5Stage0Description" value="The Master of the Forge studies an ancient lock carefully, his cybernetic eyes roving over the device's ornate surface.

The Techmarine nods in your direction -- the device is ready for activation."/>
	<entry name="SpaceMarines/Story5Stage1Description" value="Your comms network registers surprised and hostile messages from the other factions on the planet, before their forces turn in your direction. Meanwhile, legions of mindless Necron units are crawling out of the planet's surface, all heading toward the Fortress. No Marine has faced such a force and lived -- this will be a worthy death for the Chapter!"/>
	<entry name="SpaceMarines/Story5Stage2Description" value="And now the true enemy is revealed, the source of the Librarians' misgivings -- a C'tan Shard, the Deceiver. It's directing a larger assault of corrupted Guard and Necrons to your geneseed bunkers, obviously in the hope of entering them and surviving the Exterminatus. You must defend both the bunkers and the Exterminatus device until they are ready -- fight well, Marines and your names will go down in Imperial history!"/>

You and your surviving veterans are fighting a desperate rearguard in the Fortress, driven back step by step by the C'tan's forces. As you retreat into the Forge, the foul C'tan shows itself, its golden face shifting horribly through forms and faces you know. The Master of the Forge hurls himself bodily at the abomination, buying time with his life. A heartbeat after he falls, you see the C'tan scowl in horror and disgust, and lunge towards you and the Exterminatus device. As the C'tan's killing blow descends upon you, the device's whine suddenly falls silent. In the moment of its detonation and your Chapter's destruction, you feel nothing but pride at carrying out the Emperor's Will."/>

And the Hive Mind was a gourmet, sampling the local genetic data, creating warriors tailored to our weaknesses to ensure victory. Even now, I knew the Malanthropes would be massing, working behind the warriors.<br/><br/>I should have warned the Astra Militarum, I know -- but I was more concerned with protecting the products of our research. These Tyranids could be the key to defeating the next Hive Fleet. I chose to gather data, in the hope of getting it off planet, and hence I doomed this world."/>

A second hive arose to fight the first, and a real hope emerged amongst the defenders that the Hive Fleet would spend all its biomass in futile internecine war.<br/><br/>I had no such illusions.

It must have become obvious to the Hive Mind that it couldn't simply consume this world like normal -- their dreaded spore pods couldn't get through the warp storms and they couldn't breed fast enough on the surface to overcome our defenses. It needed something special to crack the planet wide open.<br/><br/>The few Imperial satellites and the Space Marine Battle Barge reported that the hive fleet was circling the planet, throwing mycetic spores downward, probing the storm.
