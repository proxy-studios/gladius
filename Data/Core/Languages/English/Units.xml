	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/BasiliskFlavor" value="When the Imperial Guard go to war, they march to the thunderous report of batteries of Basilisks whose guns can flatten cities and end worlds.

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/BullgrynDescription" value="Heavy melee infantry unit."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/BullgrynFlavor" value="Bullgryns are clad in custom-made carapace armour and carry crude assault weaponry to capitalise on the abhumans' stature and resilience.

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/HydraFlavor" value="Whether faced by lightning-fast xenos fighters or daemonic, leather-winged monstrosities, the Hydra Flak Tank is ideally equipped to blow aerial foes out of the sky. The Hydra's predictive logic-spirit singles out and locks onto its targets with the tenacity of a predatory beast."/>

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/ImperialStrongpointDescription" value="Stationary fortification unit."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/ImperialStrongpointFlavor" value="An Imperial Bastion is an imposing edifice built from foot-thick ferrocrete and the remains of faithful servants of the Imperium. As they are relatively easy to construct, some planets boast networks of Bastions that span entire continents. Built to withstand orbital strikes and artillery bombardments, there are few weapons capable of razing them in a single blow. It is with good reason that such fortresses often form the cornerstone of a planet's defensive strategy."/>

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/LemanRussBattleTankFlavor" value="The Leman Russ battle tank is an ironclad declaration of might made manifest.

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/MarauderBomberFlavor" value="Sturdily built and boasting a colossal payload for its size, the Marauder is the archetypal heavy bomber of the Imperium.

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/PrimarisPsykerDescription" value="Hero unit with destructive psychic powers."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/PrimarisPsykerFlavor" value="Loathed and feared as witches by their superstitious comrades, Primaris Psykers are nonetheless valuable assets to any commander. Though it hardly lessens the constant suspicion they are held in by the Officio Prefectus, each of these psykers possess abilities and control far beyond those of lesser Scholastica Psykana initiates."/>

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/ScoutSentinelFlavor" value="The Sentinel is a fast-moving combat walker employed to scout dense terrain and provide close infantry fire support.

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/TechpriestEnginseerFlavor" value="Tech-Priest Enginseers serve as custodians for the vehicles of the Imperial Guard. With binary prayers and mystic rites, the Enginseers soothe the machine spirits of their tracked congregation. Without the diligent maintenance of the Enginseers, the Imperial Guard would soon find themselves without the heavy armour vital to their very survival."/>

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/TempestusScionDescription" value="Elite shock infantry unit."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/TempestusScionFlavor" value="Militarum Tempestus Scions are often viewed with fear or resentment by the regular troops -- nicknames such as 'glory boys' and 'big toy soldiers' are common.

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/WyrdvanePsykerDescription" value="Psy infantry unit that specializes in debuffs."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/WyrdvanePsykerFlavor" value="Wyrdvane Psykers transform the howling might of the Warp into a deadly weapon of Imperial supremacy. They are formed from those Scholastica Psykana inductees not able to control their burgeoning powers without guidance and aid. As individuals, such psykers are unpredictable and unsafe. Yet working in concert, these deadly mutants can be a valuable asset."/>
	<entry name="CompendiumFlavor" value="Reading the histories of the 41st millenium, one might assume that the galaxy only experiences conflict. That's far from the truth -- most civilians of the Imperium live and die in peace. Yet to be conscripted into an Imperial army is almost a guarantee of death in wars against foul creatures far from your homeworld, in order that the majority of the Imperium can continue to exist in peace."/>

	<entry name="Necrons/AnnihilationBargeFlavor" value="Annihilation Barges are the Necrons' favoured anti-infantry support platforms. At the Overlord's command, the Annihilation Barges' ancient repulsor sleds are coaxed back into life and the vehicles accompany the tomb world's army to war.

	<entry name="Necrons/CanoptekScarabDescription" value="Close combat swarm unit that overwhelms the enemy with large numbers."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/CanoptekScarabFlavor" value="Canoptek Scarabs sweep across the battlefield in vast, undulating swarms that devour all in their path. Mindless feeding machines, the Scarabs are constructs designed to break down matter into raw energy that can then be woven into fresh forms. Within the confines of a tomb this process is one of clearing and manufacture, but on the battlefield it is a powerful force of destruction."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/CanoptekSpyder" value="Canoptek Spyder"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/CanoptekSpyderDescription" value="Monstrous support unit that founds new cities."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/CanoptekSpyderFlavor" value="Though essentially an automated drone, a Canoptek Spyder is nonetheless a formidable foe. Its vast array of self-repair and backup systems -- vital for enduring uncaring millennia -- offer substantial protection against incoming fire.

	<entry name="Necrons/CryptekFlavor" value="Crypteks bend the forces of the universe to their will, creating impossible technologies and esoteric weaponry to lay waste to armies and destroy worlds.

	<entry name="Necrons/DestroyerLord" value="Destroyer Lord"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/DestroyerLordDescription" value="Hero unit with exceptional close combat capabilities."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/DestroyerLordFlavor" value="Destroyer Lords are the most maniacal of their kind. This is chiefly because they retain far more intellect than baseline Destroyers, and can bring all of this fearsome intelligence to bear in their pursuit of universal oblivion. Indeed, in a galaxy overspilling with genocidal despots, Destroyer Lords remain worthy of mention as something truly horrific. Where others kill for pleasure, or in service to some malignant god, Destroyer Lords pursue their bloody crusade simply because they can."/>

	<entry name="Necrons/DoomScytheDescription" value="Versatile airborne fighter unit."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/DoomScytheFlavor" value="Doom Scythes are heralds of terror and dismay. These supersonic fighter craft range ahead of a Necron army, drawing upon their strategic datastacks to operate with virtual autonomy. Whether performing terror-raids as a precursor to invasion, keeping the air free of enemy aircraft, or launching overwhelming strike missions against key strategic targets, Doom Scythe pilots will complete their task with merciless precision."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/DoomsdayArk" value="Doomsday Ark"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/DoomsdayArkDescription" value="Vehicle unit with devastating firepower."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/DoomsdayArkFlavor" value="Victory through overwhelming firepower is a common tenet of Necron strategic thinking. Nowhere is this more evident than in the Doomsday Ark. Though deceptively fragile at first glance, the Doomsday Ark is a self-propelled energy cannon whose raw, unsubtle firepower is so vastly destructive that a single shot can turn the tide of a battle."/>

	<entry name="Necrons/HeavyDestroyerDescription" value="Powerful anti-armour infantry unit."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/HeavyDestroyerFlavor" value="Armed with oversized gauss cannons, Heavy Destroyers send blazing energy blasts searing across the battlefield. These heavily armed adherents of the Destroyer Cults glide across scorched earth scanning for victims, the flickering light of their weapons' energy cores echoing the cold hatred in their optics. When a Heavy Destroyer's targeting lens focuses upon an enemy, the battlefield recedes in its mind until only hunter and prey remain, the compulsion to kill drowning out everything else."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Immortal" value="Immortals"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/ImmortalDescription" value="Medium-range armoured infantry unit."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/ImmortalFlavor" value="Even before biotransference, the Immortals were the elite soldiers of the Necrontyr and marched at the forefront of their galactic conquests. Reborn into tireless metal bodies, they are now the shock troops of each tomb world's armies. Where Necron Warriors are but fodder to be fed to the guns of the foe, Immortals are far more valuable to their Overlords and will be deployed accordingly. Heavily armed and armoured, they will stop at nothing in the completion of their masters' goals, and will often be found at the heart of any crushing offensive or punitive counter-attack."/>

	<entry name="Necrons/LordFlavor" value="These Lords of the Necrons, though lesser in stature and power than an Overlord or phaeron, are nonetheless formidable foes in their own right, and often march to war at the head of a vast mechanical army.

	<entry name="Necrons/NightScytheDescription" value="Airborne transport unit."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/NightScytheFlavor" value="The Night Scythe is the Necrons' favoured tool of invasion, a sickle-winged herald of woe that possesses the ability to beam Necrons directly into battle. Manoeuvrable enough to evade orbital defences and interceptors, and swift enough to outpace mustering foes, Night Scythes can ghost through a defence perimeter to deploy invasion forces well behind enemy lines."/>

	<entry name="Necrons/ObeliskFlavor" value="The Obelisk hovers low over the battlefield, the somnolent hum of its gravitic repulsors sowing dread in the hearts of the foe. As it drifts into view, black lightning arcing across its glowing hull, the Obelisk presents a darkly majestic sight. Yet wonder turns swiftly to horror as the Obelisk's weapons cycle up, glowing tesla spheres irising open to spit crawling skeins of lightning that reduce those nearby to blackened, twitching husks."/>

	<entry name="Necrons/TranscendentCtanFlavor" value="Transcendent C'tan are all that remain of the once mighty star-gods. They are echoes of their former selves, splinters of energy that survived the Necrons' betrayal and were trammelled in tesseract labyrinths. Ancient, archaic technologies shackle these beings to the will of their Necron masters, compelling them to obey and reducing them to the merest echoes of their ancient majesty. Yet even in their reduced and fettered state, Transcendent C'tan are still beings of immense power."/>

	<entry name="Necrons/WarriorDescription" value="Basic infantry unit."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/WarriorFlavor" value="Even with only a glimmer of consciousness to guide it, a Necron Warrior is a fearsome and resilient foe.

	<entry name="Neutral/Artefacts/AccuracyFlavor" value="Inside this obelisk's dark metal, is an eggshell-coloured interior.

These machines are walking relics from aeons past, and all the deadlier for it -- the air nearby thrums with power, bullets ricocheting from repulsor fields that glow like golden cages around them.

Its devastating guns reduce swathes of victims to ruin, drowning them in jets of red-hot gore or burying them under rains of gnashing skulls. As it ploughs through the enemy ranks, the Daemon Engine wields its roaring cleaver with a speed and skill that is entirely horrifying in something so huge. Entire ranks of enemy warriors are swept away with a single swing, tanks and monstrous beasts swatted through the air like toys. Even towering war engines such as Stompas or Titans are made to look clumsy and sluggish as the Lord of Skulls hacks off their limbs and tears open their armoured torsos amid blossoms of dirty flame. Few warriors can face the Lord of Skulls and live, for it is a machine of absolute destruction."/>

These third and fourth generation hybrids can pass for human -- some are even cunning enough to infiltrate the Astra Militarum.

Completely lethal in gun battles, boarding actions and the like, a mob of Gitz opening fire is nothing short of cataclysmic.

	<entry name="Tyranids/LictorFlavor" value="The Lictor is a highly specialised development of the Tyranid Warrior bioform, specifically adapted to fill a scout role in the vanguard of the Tyranid advance. Lictors rove ahead of the main body of a swarm, seeking out pockets of resistance to be eradicated and native life forms to be absorbed. Able to move swiftly and without sound through even the densest terrain, and concealed by a chameleonic carapace that renders it all but invisible to the naked eye, a Lictor can remain hidden until it chooses to strike. It can wait motionless for days, unnoticed by its victims, an unseen herald of approaching disaster."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Malanthrope" value="Malanthrope"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/MalanthropeDescription" value="Support unit that consumes tiles and founds new cities."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/MalanthropeFlavor" value="Malanthropes are rarely seen Tyranid creatures. This is because they are not truly warrior organisms, and so are not usually encountered by a prey world's defenders. Instead, these floating creatures follow behind the Tyranid attack; they are typically created only after a prey world's protectors have been defeated and the swarm is in the process of devouring the planet's biomass. On those few occasions that a survivor has seen a Malanthrope and somehow escaped, they have brought with them a tale of horror. They report seeing these giants drift across corpse-strewn battlefields, but unlike other Tyranids, which mindlessly devour everything in their way, Malanthropes seem to selectively search through the slain -- as to what they are searching for, none can say."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Ravener" value="Raveners"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/RavenerDescription" value="Fast beast unit bred for close combat."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/RavenerFlavor" value="Raveners are voracious predators, their clawed and snake-like bodies driven onwards by an all-consuming hunger. Twisted musculature grants these beasts a terrifying turn of speed. Raveners can bound over small obstacles in an eye-blink, dart between larger obstructions and even slither through flooded marshland with bewildering swiftness. The power housed within the Raveners' wiry forms allows them to burrow long distances beneath a world's surface, before emerging in a spray of earth right in front of an enemy position, claws eviscerating their ambushed prey whilst their thorax-mounted weapon symbiotes spit death."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Termagant" value="Termagants"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/TermagantDescription" value="Basic infantry unit."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/TermagantFlavor" value="Termagants are agile and cunning creatures. They are amongst the smallest of the Hive Mind's warriors and were originally created to roam the arterial passages of bio-ships in search of intruders. In planetary invasions, Termagants scuttle forwards on four legs whilst unleashing torrents of fire from the anti-personnel bio-weaponry -- commonly fleshborers -- clutched in their clawed forelimbs."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Tervigon" value="Tervigon"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/TervigonDescription" value="Synapse hero unit that spawns armies of Termagants."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/TervigonFlavor" value="The Tervigon is a massive synapse creature whose towering carapace shields a swollen abdomen. Though possessed of a formidable array of bio-weapons, from monstrous claws that crush any prey that ventures too close, to banks of razor-tipped spines that can be fired a considerable distance, the Tervigon's true threat lies within... Every Tervigon serves as a living incubator, within whose bloated form dozens upon dozens of Termagants slumber in a state of near-life. The Tervigon can spawn its dormant broods at will, jolting their minds into wakefulness."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Trygon" value="Trygon"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/TrygonDescription" value="Monstrous creature unit that can initiate subterranean assaults."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/TrygonFlavor" value="The Trygon is a vast serpentine creature, so colossal that it towers over even the mighty Carnifex. It is a heavily armoured monster, covered from head to tail with a thick carapace of shifting plates. As the Trygon moves, these plates generate a potent bio-static charge that courses along the length of the beast's body and wreathes its bladed forelimbs with crackling power. The Trygon can direct this energy as a lethal high-voltage discharge -- unleashing pulsing arcs of lightning that leave its prey as little more than a charred pile of scorched bones."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Tunnel" value="Broodhive"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/TunnelDescription" value="Allows units to tunnel from one Broodhive to another."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/TunnelFlavor" value="Where the Tyranids arrive, the plants that constitute the Broodhive travel with them. Rapidly proliferating from seeds left by the Tyranid swarm as they pass, these plants burrow their giant hollow roots through soil, metal or stone, enabling Tyranids to pass undetected between areas."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/TyranidPrime" value="Tyranid Prime"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/TyranidPrimeDescription" value="Fearsome synapse hero unit that boosts allied Tyranid Warriors."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/TyranidPrimeFlavor" value="Tyranid Primes are the apex of the Tyranid Warrior strain, faster, stronger and smarter than the other Warriors they lead to battle, who instinctively emulate their deadly skill."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Tyrannofex" value="Tyrannofex"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/TyrannofexDescription" value="Monstrous creature unit with long-range weaponry that annihilates even the heaviest vehicles."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/TyrannofexFlavor" value="There can be little doubt that the massive Tyrannofex exists purely for destruction -- it is a monster created for the most apocalyptic and gruelling of battlegrounds. Striding ominously towards their prey, these alien giants deal death from afar, shattering enemy battle lines with merciless salvos of bio-weapons fire. The only way to stop the unrelenting slaughter is to slay the beast, but a Tyrannofex has the fortitude of a living battle fortress and is heedless of all but the heaviest enemy ordnance. Clad in ablative layers of chitinous armour, a Tyrannofex is as unyielding as any war engine built of steel or born of conventional technology."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Warrior" value="Tyranid Warriors"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/WarriorDescription" value="Versatile synapse infantry unit."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/WarriorFlavor" value="Tyranid Warriors are the most adaptable of all the Hive Mind's bioforms. They are creatures from the blackest of nightmares, unstoppable killing machines with pulsing ichor for blood, needle-sharp teeth and darkly gleaming eyes that reveal a terrible intelligence at work. A Tyranid Warrior stands twice the height of a man, its carapace protected by a thick chitin. One might expect such a creature to be slow in its actions, but a Tyranid Warrior is lithe, with reactions as swift as a whip."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Zoanthrope" value="Zoanthropes"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/ZoanthropeDescription" value="Synapse infantry unit with devastating psychic capabilities."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/ZoanthropeFlavor" value="Zoanthropes are created solely to harness the psychic potential of the Hive Mind, and their entire bodies are perfected towards such a function. If necessary, a Zoanthrope can be used to extend the range of the Hive Mind's synaptic control, utilising the beast's vast cerebral capacity to relay its instructions to lesser creatures. A Zoanthrope's link to the synaptic web is such that, by flexing the merest part of its mind, it can rain incandescent power on the enemy, projecting destructive bolts of energy that boils through adamantium plate and disintegrates flesh with equal ease."/>
