	<entry name="AegisHarness" value="Aegis Harness"/>
	<entry name="AegisHarnessDescription" value="Blocks the damage and effects of the next enemy psychic power against the unit."/>
	<entry name="AegisHarnessFlavor" value="Imbued with psycho-conductive filaments and hexagrammic wards, Aegis armour represents perhaps the Imperium's most effective defence against psychic attack. Most commonly employed by the Inquisition's Ordo Malleus in their crusade to purge the taint of Chaos from the galaxy."/>
	<entry name="AdamantiumWeaveVest" value="Adamantium Weave Vest"/>
	<entry name="AdamantiumWeaveVestDescription" value="Increases the armour of the unit."/>
	<entry name="AdamantiumWeaveVestFlavor" value="When you want to make something invulnerable, you make it from adamantium. Used in the construction of both Terminator Armour or the construction of Titans, this is the strongest material known to man. This vest only has a tiny amount in it, woven in with plasteel and ceramite, but it's enough to make it exceedingly protective."/>
	<entry name="ArmaplasBracers" value="Armaplas Bracers"/>
	<entry name="ArmaplasBracersDescription" value="Increases the armour of the unit."/>
	<entry name="ArmaplasBracersFlavor" value="Made of the same material as the Imperial Carapace Armour, these matched sets of arm shields mildly increase the wearer's survivability. It's the built-in tactical cogitators, however, that give the wearer a much better hope of living through the next fight."/>
	<entry name="BlightGrenade" value="Blight Grenade"/>
	<entry name="BlightGrenadeDescription" value="Deals damage to the target enemy unit each turn."/>
	<entry name="BlightGrenadeFlavor" value="The use of the diseases contained in Blight Grenades was a war crime in ancient history. Modern examples are rare, but the Chaos Marines of Nurgle often create their own, with the shrapnel forcing lethal pathogens into the tiniest cracks in armour."/>
	<entry name="BlindGrenade" value="Blind Grenade"/>
	<entry name="BlindGrenadeDescription" value="Reduces the accuracy of the target enemy unit."/>
	<entry name="BlindGrenadeFlavor" value="Blind grenades are a more complex version of a smoke grenade, releasing a dense dark grey smoke cloud, as well as infrared bafflers,broad spectrum electromagnetic radiation and chaff to disrupt enemy scanners. The broad range of interference makes most forms of direct attack through it impossible for a short time."/>
	<entry name="CombatStimulant" value="Combat Stimulant"/>
	<entry name="CombatStimulantDescription" value="Increases the damage of the unit."/>
	<entry name="CombatStimulantFlavor" value="Combat Stimulants like Frenzon or Onslaught are regarded with distaste by most species, given that their manufacture and testing sometimes require the liquidation of innocent victims (especially if Slaaneshi cults are involved). Despite this, the Imperial forces dispense these regularly to both Penal Legions and the much-feared Eversor Assassins."/>
	<entry name="CompendiumFlavor" value="Though the surface of Gladius was regularly scoured of useful materials and resources during its millenia of occupation, it still threw up unique items, attracting in its time many travelling traders, including the mysterious Jokaero. The recent ructions and warp storms have stirred its shattered surface further and thrown up all manner of strange items. Who knows what the Jokaero will find next?"/>
	<entry name="ConcealedWeaponSystem" value="Concealed Weapon System"/>
	<entry name="ConcealedWeaponSystemDescription" value="Increases the attacks of the unit."/>
	<entry name="ConcealedWeaponSystemFlavor" value="Hiding a weapon isn't a new idea, but a true Concealed Weapon System secretes the killing tool in such a way that it's undetectable until use -- as clothing, jewellery or even as biological elements. The element of surprise heavily increases its efficacy."/>
	<entry name="EnduranceImplant" value="Endurance Implant"/>
	<entry name="EnduranceImplantDescription" value="Increases the movement of the unit."/>
	<entry name="EnduranceImplantFlavor" value="An atypical Jokaero device, this implant weaves its way into the host organism, to optimise its biological systems. Its user will find itself tireless, able to run faster, fight for longer, and generally keep going -- until its overwrought body gives way, that is."/>
	<entry name="ForbiddenKnowledge" value="Forbidden Knowledge"/>
	<entry name="ForbiddenKnowledgeDescription" value="Increases the level of the unit."/>
	<entry name="ForbiddenKnowledgeFlavor" value="This box of black stone is heavily inscribed in ancient runes, possibly Exodite, possibly Old One. Who knows what it holds? Whispered secrets an aeon-old? Deadly traps? Miracles of knowledge long thought lost? Unholy power from unholy gods? Only a soul brave enough to open it and discover for themselves will ever know..."/>
	<entry name="JokaeroDigitalWeapon" value="Jokaero Digital Weapon"/>
	<entry name="JokaeroDigitalWeaponDescription" value=""/>
	<entry name="JokaeroDigitalWeaponFlavor" value="Miniaturized killing tools of remarkable power, commonly concealed within jewellery, and created by a race of primate-like xenos with an apparently instinctive understanding of technology. The Imperium has, as yet, been unable to replicate the construction of these digi-weapons."/>
	<entry name="LightningGauntlet" value="Lightning Gauntlet"/>
	<entry name="LightningGauntletDescription" value="Increases the damage of the unit's next melee attack."/>
	<entry name="LightningGauntletFlavor" value="With talons created from adamantium and the telltale blue glow of a power weapon, Lightning Claws are normally only mounted on Terminator armour. However rare single gauntlets can be found small enough to be carried by a normal warrior."/>
	<entry name="ManCatcher" value="Man-Catcher"/>
	<entry name="ManCatcherDescription" value="Reduces the movement and accuracy of the target enemy unit."/>
	<entry name="ManCatcherFlavor" value="An ancient capture device whose spiked collar violently dissuades its prisoner from attempting escape, and may loosen their tongue to boot. Though most consider it too primitive a weapon, a handful of Inquisitors are resolute that its simple barbarism achieves results that more contemporary methods simply cannot."/>
	<entry name="MourningBladeOfLazaerek" value="Mourning Blade Of Lazaerek"/>
	<entry name="MourningBladeOfLazaerekDescription" value="Grants a cleave effect to all melee weapons of the unit."/>
	<entry name="MourningBladeOfLazaerekFlavor" value="Little survived when an apparently disastrous jump saw the last remnants of the Fire Hawks Chapter lost to the warp in 963.M41, but a few alleged relics yet remain. This axe was thought to belong to their rancorous grand master, Stibor Lazaerek, under whose command the Chapter's ranks were decimated during the lethal rebellions of the Badab War."/>
	<entry name="PoweredBolas" value="Powered Bolas"/>
	<entry name="PoweredBolasDescription" value="Reduces the movement and accuracy of the target enemy unit."/>
	<entry name="PoweredBolasFlavor" value="On the Imperium's savannah worlds, the local forces often adopt these traditional devices, taken from the local Grox herders. The three-powered weights at the end of the wire do little harm to the target -- but so thoroughly entangle it that it can be dealt with at leisure."/>
	<entry name="PoweredGauntlet" value="Powered Gauntlet"/>
	<entry name="PoweredGauntletDescription" value="Increases the melee damage of the unit."/>
	<entry name="PoweredGauntletFlavor" value="This may look like a simple steel glove, with randomly-placed technology all over it. Yet, as the Administratum say, 'caveat emptor' -- for the Jokaero technology in it makes it the match of the larger power fists and power claws employed by the Imperial and Ork forces."/>
	<entry name="RecoveryPackage" value="Recovery Package"/>
	<entry name="RecoveryPackageDescription" value="Restores the hitpoints of the unit."/>
	<entry name="RecoveryPackageFlavor" value="This medkit has been thrown together with little sense or reason, perhaps by a Jokaero or an Ork Mad Dok with an instinctive sense of medicine, but there's no doubting the efficacy of its contents. Whatever the injury, there's a neatly-mislabelled package in here that will fix it."/>
	<entry name="StunGrenade" value="Stun Grenade"/>
	<entry name="StunGrenadeDescription" value="Prevents the target enemy unit from acting."/>
	<entry name="StunGrenadeFlavor" value="An ancient design, Stun grenades use a combination of a loud explosion and a bright flash to temporarily disable any combatants in the blast area."/>
	<entry name="TemporaryShield" value="Temporary Shield"/>
	<entry name="TemporaryShieldDescription" value="Increases the armour of the unit."/>
	<entry name="TemporaryShieldFlavor" value="Portable shield generators are fairly rare amongst most species, given the technical capability and rare resources needed to make them. They also burn out quickly, but their ability to stop even the most powerful attacks dead in their tracks make them invaluable."/>
	<entry name="VolcanisShroud" value="Volcanis Shroud"/>
	<entry name="VolcanisShroudDescription" value="Grants witchfire damage reduction to the unit."/>
	<entry name="VolcanisShroudFlavor" value="Though this battered, heat-resistant armour was originally designed for industrial work at the deepest and most hazardous layers of Hive Worlds, by some happy accident it also muffles psychic attack. As yet, whatever gives the Shroud this quality has not been identified, for fear that reverse-engineering it may break its uncanny spell."/>
	<entry name="ZoatHideJerkin" value="Zoat Hide Jerkin"/>
	<entry name="ZoatHideJerkinDescription" value="Increases the hitpoints and healing rate of the unit."/>
	<entry name="ZoatHideJerkinFlavor" value="The Zoat, a genetically-engineered slave race in the thrall of the Tyranids, have been all but absent from the galaxy for generations. Though renowned for their unusual intelligence and charisma, their dense, scaled skin also made them a frighteningly resilient foe. Zoat-hide armour is vanishingly rare now, but a true boon upon the battlefield."/>
